						<!-- RISK DETAILS -->
						<article id="risk" class="panel">

								<h2>RISK</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Risk Game created for the Software Engineering module in Second Year. My teammate and I were
							tasked with implementing the Risk board game in Java. We decided to use JavaFX to give ourselves
							the most flexibility and allow ourselves to get creative. We deviated significantly from the sample
							solution code , which you will see below as our Bot was made to run on it. We received a perfect grade
							for this project.</p>
							<p>The foundation of our game lies on the "pixel map" we created. We created a grid of 5x5 squares, giving us
							a screen of pixels which we had full control over. We then created the map on top, tracking which pixels were
							countries/borders or the ocean.</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/risk_start.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The countries are randomly divided among the players at the start of the game. A country owned by a player changes to their
							colour. The pixel map allowed us to have the pleasant animation of the grey countries filling with colour as the game begins.</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/risk_takeOver.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>There are two prominent features shown in this gif. The first is that clicking on a country will fill the text box with its name.
							Part of the assignment specification was string validation and as such it was required that the user type in country names. We thought this interrupted
							the flow of the game, it is still present but the player can also simply click the country to save time.</p>
							<p>The second is the conquering animation. When a player takes over a country, a breadth first search is initiated from
							a central node, changing the colour and terminating when a border is reached.</p>

						<!-- WEBSCRAPER DETAILS -->
						<article id="webscraper" class="panel">

								<h2>WEBSCRAPER</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Webscraper I built in Python to help in finding a house to rent. It scrapes data from the four
							largest property websites in Ireland - (daft.ie, let.ie, myhome.ie and rent.ie) and stores the data
							in a csv file. It then converts the csv to a dataframe to allow filtering and a cleaner method to display the data.</p>
							<p>The program will begin scraping after clicking the start button. This will take approximately 7 minutes.
								Scraping from daft.ie takes the longest amount of time as it's website is partially loaded with javascript. I used Selenium
								to open a headless browser of Google Chrome and then got the data I needed from there using BeautfiulSoup. BeautifulSoup
								on it's own was enough for the rest of the websites.</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/webscraper_load.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The load properties button will load all properties found into the display on the GUI. Some properties have a price
							of 0, this is the default value for properties with no price.</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/webscraper_loadnew.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The load new properties will load all new properties found since the last search. This allows for quick checking of recently added
							properties.</p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/webscraper_filter.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Filter functionality for the price per month and the number of beds. These two attributes were uniform across
							the four websites while also being the key elements that I was looking for in a rental home. </p>
							<a class="image fit"><img src="gifs/webscraper_link.gif" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Double clicking the link will open it in your browser.</p>
